# My [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com) blog
This blog follows my progress in the [fulltime online software engineering program](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp/online) at Flatiron School. There will be seven posts in total; the first one is introductory, the next five will talk about my five major project milestones, and the final post will be about my last capstone project. Rad!
