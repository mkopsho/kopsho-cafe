description: "In my 9ish years of experience working in the technology industry, I've worked in varied levels of the organization: individual contributor, people manager, and work manager. Currently, I'm a project manager by name and a coach and educator in practice. I help teams make sense of their work through work visualization, experimentation and validation, and sensemaking. 

My experience in these different roles at a rapidly-growing software company has shown me that we need sensible thinking at each level of an organization. We need leaders who are focused on strategy, are well-informed of the rapidly-changing ecosystem around them, and can sense and respond to those changes appropriately. We need to enable teams to make well-informed, business-aligned decisions, deliver high-quality work at a sustainable pace, and run low-risk experiments with short feedback loops. 

All of this is easier said than done; none of it is trivial. I'm professionally focused on and dedicated to making these goals a reality. I'm currently looking for opportunities in this space as a management or agile coach."
