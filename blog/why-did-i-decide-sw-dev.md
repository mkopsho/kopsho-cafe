# Why did I decide to learn software development?
#### May 2020
 
I've actually been working in the tech industry for some time. You may be asking, "hwhat? Why would you join a coding bootcamp if you already have a job working in tech?". I've asked myself the same question more than once!

I recently got done with a 7-year stint at a mid-stage startup. Working for this startup was fantastic for me; I got to work on a small team full of smart people, learned *a ton* on the job, and got to build big things. I was working in Infrastructure/Operations so I got to touch a bit of everything computer-related! The startup was very successful, grew very fast, and eventually cornered the market on email marketing ([nbd](https://marketingland.com/mailchimp-claims-over-60-share-of-email-industry-in-latest-report-273926)). As we grew, we realized that we needed folks to help people coalesce and organize around work in an efficient and sustainable way.

That was in 2015. That is also when I decided to become a manager. Y'know, to help with the coalescing and organizing.

I have been in management roles since then doing what needed to be done. While it was rewarding in its own way, I never really felt "at home" as a manager. I found myself gravitating more towards technical interests. But the only way I could be involved in that work at my job was at a very high, very "managerial" level. This got me thinking about what I'd like to do, rather than continuing to do what I was already doing and that I didn't really enjoy.

Also, while coding is obviously steeped in science and mathematics, it is just unknown and abstract enough to me to feel like alchemy. I can take essentially nothing and transmute it into an application, website, you name it. I can move data from here to there and back again, transforming it along the way. I can try stuff and experiment quickly, roll back if needed, and try again with something different. That feels very good!

Aaaaaaaaaaaannd that's why I'm here! I want to clear my mind, tabula rasa style, and learn how to build things with code. The rigor and pace of coding bootcamps really jives with how I like to learn and do, not to mention that I have a cohort of determined folks to keep me honest about what I signed up to do.

I'm hoping to learn a lot, build some things, and ultimately have some fun. I also expect some blood, sweat, and tears, and I'm here for that as well!
