This blog follows my progress in the [fulltime online software engineering program](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp/online) at Flatiron School from May to September 2020. There will be seven posts in total; the first one is introductory, the next five will talk about my five major project milestones, and the final post will be about my last capstone project. Rad!

1. [Why did I decide to learn software development?](./why-did-i-decide-sw-dev.html)
2. [CLIs and RPGs: an old-school interface for an old-school game](./cli-and-rpg-old-school.html)
3. TBD!
