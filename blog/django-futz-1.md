## Striking Out

`strike out`, *verb*
> 1: to enter upon a course of action
> 2: to set out vigorously

It's been about 3 weeks since I [graduated from coding bootcamp](./flatiron/trials-and-tribulations.html) and I've hit the job search **HARD**. I'm tracking all job leads in a Trello board, using a spreadsheet to track contacts/code commits/blog posts, and leveraging Flatiron's extensive resources and my career coach to help me manage it all.

While job hunting is my #1 priority, I also want to keep learning and building things with a similar intensity to the bootcamp. This is hard to do as I'm not an expert in other languages or frameworks, I don't have a daily structure for learning, and I'm not even sure what to learn. It's time to strike out on my own!

Fortunately my job search was able to help guide my discipline; each listing has its own set of minimum and bonus requirements that the hiring company is looking for in a candidate. A frequent requirement that I saw was experience with a modern cloud computing platform like AWS or GCP. While I have transferrable experience from my past gigs as a datacenter junkie, I needed to shore up my knowledge of cloud'y abstractions. This spurred my purchase of the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/) for $12 in a pretty tubular sale they had a month back. This course is intended to equip students with the knowledge to get the associate certificate, which I intend to do.

Aside from modern cloud computing platforms, I wanted to learn more languages, frameworks, and interesting or newer ways of building technology. My little Trello collection of potential jobs covers the gamut of technology, so I figure I should at least dabble in a bunch of them while entering the field. Enter Python, Django, and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). I wanted to create a barebones Django backend which would be fronted with React and use GraphQL to ferry data back and forth.

## Enter Django!
![df-enter](../../images/django-futz/df-enter.gif)

Django is commonly referred to as Python's equivalent to Rails. I've already [dabbled](./flatiron/rails-the-great-humbler.html) with [Rails](./flatiron/slaying-trout-with-json.html) a [bunch](./flatiron/react-conventions-and-stewardship.html), so I felt confident in my ability to figure Django out.

And because Django has a rich community and documentation, I did just that! First of all, the Python community has many tools that help users create independent virtual environments so that their Python versions, packages, and other Pythonic miscellany stay scoped to the project that they're trying to build. I decided to use [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv):
```
pyenv virtualenv 3.6.10 django-app
pyenv activate django-app
```
If my virtual environment is appropriately activated, my terminal prompt prepends itself with the name of the current environment that I'm in (`django-app`). This locks my Python version to the one I created the environment with (`3.6.10`). This also means that any packages I install via `pip` will stay isolated to that environment, which makes dependency management a breeze.

To actually start my Django app, I need some packages:
```
pip install django==2.1.4 graphene-django==2.2.0
```
We're installing [graphene](https://graphene-python.org/) here to give us a nice library to play with GraphQL in our Django app.

And, like Rails, Django provides some helpers to generate and run some framework-specific code:
```
django-admin startproject django-app
cd django-app
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
If you've built a Rails app before, you can likely tell what these programs are doing: setting up our project's file structure, running initial database migrations, and running a webserver! This webserver runs on `http://localhost:8000` by default, and, like Rails, you should see a default page showing that you didn't futz it up too hard:

Django has the concept of `INSTALLED_APPS`, which is a list of applications in `settings.py` that are enabled in our overall Django app. We need to add our `graphene_django` package here and also need to let that package know where to find our app's schema:
```
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # Default packages...
    'graphene_django',
)

...

GRAPHENE = {
    'SCHEMA': 'django-app.schema.schema',
}
```

Django also has a Rails equivalent to [Resources](https://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/Resources/resources) simply called `apps`. We can make an `app` with the following:
```
python manage.py startapp links
```

This is very similar to Rails' resource generators in that it will provide you with some boilerplate MVC code, like `links/models.py`, `links/views.py`, etc. In order to actually use our `Links` model, we need to define it (in `links/models.py`):
```
class Link(models.Model):
    url = models.URLField()
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
```
This will set up a `Links` class with a `url` and a `description`. It also has an `id`, but just like with Rails, those are added only when an object instance is saved to the database. This should look very similar to a typical Rails model definition. One difference is that Django deals in [field types](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/fields/), which helpfully have some validators baked in depending on the type of data you're expecting.

Remember that `INSTALLED_APPS` list from before? Well, since `links` is technically an `app`, we need to add it there:
```
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # Add after the `graphene_django` app
    'links',
)
```

And, as in Rails, every time we touch our data model we will need to migrate our schema to reflect those changes:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Now that we have our data model setup, we can easily create some dummy data by running `python manage.py shell`:
```
>>> from links.models import Link
>>> Link.objects.create(url='https://kopsho.cafe/', description='My personal site')
>>> Link.objects.create(url='https://twitter.com/natl_park_pics/', description='Pics of national parks')
```
This should look **very** similar to running a Rails console with `rails c` and instantiating some objects that way!

And that's (almost) it for our Django portion! We've fairly easily set up a virtual environment, an entire Django app, and a very simple data model for the app. Now that all that setup is out of the way, we'll move on to [Graphene/GraphQL in part 2 of this series](./django-futz-2.html).
