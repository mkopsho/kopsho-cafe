# Hi! I'm Michael Kopsho. 
# Here's a bunch of stuff that I've done.
## My professional intent:
After working for 5 years in management roles, I'm seeking a change in my career. I've joined the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com) and am currently taking their [Software Engineering course](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp/atlanta#curriculum). I should graduate in late September if all goes well!
