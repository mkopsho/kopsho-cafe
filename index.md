# Resume
## Intent
In my 9ish years of experience working in the technology industry, I've worked in varied levels of the organization: individual contributor, people manager, and work manager. Currently, I'm a project manager by name and a coach and educator in practice. I help teams make sense of their work through work visualization, experimentation and validation, and sensemaking.

My experience in these different roles at a rapidly-growing software company has shown me that we need sensible thinking at each level of an organization. We need leaders who are focused on strategy, are well-informed of the rapidly-changing ecosystem around them, and can sense and respond to those changes appropriately. We need to enable teams to make well-informed, business-aligned decisions, deliver high-quality work at a sustainable pace, and run low-risk experiments with short feedback loops.

All of this is easier said than done; none of it is trivial. I'm professionally focused on and dedicated to making these goals a reality. I'm currently looking for opportunities in this space as a management or agile coach or educator.

## Personal Word Cloud
Here is a list things that I have direct experience with:

People management, project management, process management, systems thinking, workshop facilitation, didactic and experiential education, conflict resolution, change management, workflow and organizational design and implementation, Kanban, Lean, Scrum, Six Sigma, pair programming, Jira, Confluence, Impact Mapping, User Story Mapping, CD3.

I've also run enterprise hardware at large scale, which granted me direct experience with Linux (CentOS) and bash, Git and Gitflow, Puppet, MySQL, apache, nginx, PHP, Python, Ruby, Zabbix, Elasticsearch and Kibana, Pagerduty.

## Experience

### MailChimp, Atlanta 
**Project Manager, Engineering**<br>
**March 2016 - Present**
* Track _all_ work across the entire Engineering department. This includes in-flight work, future options, and completed work.
* Manage major technical projects, including: 
	The design and implementation of our internal S3-like infrastructure leveraging Ceph.
	Development of a fault-tolerant Django application that managed, provisioned, and ordered all of our physical and virtual infrastructure.
	Implementation of MySQL database pools within the Mailchimp monolith application for more efficient scale and fault tolerance.
* Select many different project management tools and techniques depending on the project type, including kanban-inspired work visualization, WIP limiting, and continuous improvement, pair programming, gantt-like visualizations of work sequencing and timelines, and scrumlike ceremonies and sprint planning.
* Create a lightweight project management processes to handle work ideation, ingress, visualization, project prioritization and sequencing, availability planning, execution, and retrospection.
* Foster a community of practice centered around agile and lean concepts and activities, continuous process improvement, team facilitation, and workshopping.
* Incorporate workshops to help teams experiment with their workflows and improve their processes. Topics included work visualization, productivity tools, just-in-time flow, getting from obstacles to outcomes, and prioritization techniques.
* Embed in and coach multiple technical teams through continual agile improvements depending on their needs and desires. Teams include our Site Reliability team, our Systems Services team, and our Networking teams.

**Manager, Systems Engineering**<br>
**February 2015 - February 2016**
* Grew the Systems Engineering team from two to 10 engineers through heavy recruitment, interviews, onboarding programs, and continuous training.
* Created an internal support and project pipeline which managed internal customer requests for work, lowered response times, and visualized team capacity. The team still has a similar process in place to this day, which allows them to take on more requests per week, have stronger feedback loops with internal customers, and reduce cycle times and work blockages.
* Worked with the team to build an emergency response framework which handled alerting, incident response and command, and post-mortems. Lessons from this are helping us to respond more efficiently and effectively to outages that affect our users, and we still have this process in place today.
* Designed a simple on-call system that staffed team members to specific functions based on work types that came to the team and our capacity to take on that work.
* Managed a project to build out our Seattle datacenter which houses our disaster recovery databases. This project was the first officially managed project at Mailchimp, and it showed the value add that an explicit project management job function provides.

**Systems Engineer**<br>
**May 2013 - February 2015**
* Worked in a small team to directly build out and scale two colocated data centers in Atlanta and Suwanee, GA to handle Mailchimp’s rapidly growing user base.
* Designed baked-in redundancy across each layer of our infrastructure: firewalls, routers, switches, ethernet ports, load balancers, web servers, databases, power supplies, and power circuits were all redundant in some way.
* Led the effort to transfer all of our infrastructure from SoftLayer to our colocated facilities, which led to reduced mean time to failure for our systems and increased uptime for our users.
* Built and configured software and network infrastructure to scale our physical infrastructure, which handled growth from five to nine million users during my time in this role.
* Provisioned infrastructure for Mailchimp’s developers and worked on onboarding materials to enable a self-service approach to getting an application to production.
* Part of the team that built the Mailchimp Pro product offering, which formed the foundation of our “data pipeline” for use by any Mailchimp application.
* Piloted Jira and Confluence to keep track of all of our work on the team, which was adopted by the whole department and eventually the entire company.

### Akamai Technologies, Atlanta
**Network Infrastructure Technician**<br>
**August 2011 - May 2013**
