# Hi! I'm Michael Kopsho. 
# Here's a bunch of stuff that I've done.
## My Professional Intent
Hi! After working for 5 years in management roles, I'm seeking a change in my career. I'm joining the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com) and taking their [Software Engineering course](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp/atlanta#curriculum) in the summer/fall of 2020.

My last company, Mailchimp, provided me with fantastic opportunities to learn, grow, and change with the company. We had about 150 employees when I started compared with 1200 now. We had a couple of million customers when I started and have about 12 million now. That's intense growth, and my job experience matches that intensity: I have had three pretty different jobs in my 7-year tenure to meet the ever-changing needs of the company. Absurd (in a good way)!

Over time, I realized that I wanted to refocus my attention on the thing that got me into this industry in the first place: computers! And Flatiron feels like the perfect way to bootstrap this focus. After the course, I'll be actively seeking software engineer positions at a place building cool shit. _I'll help you build that cool shit_.

## My Experience

### [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), Atlanta 
**Project Manager, Engineering**<br>
**March 2016 - Present**
* Track _all_ work across the entire Engineering department. This includes in-flight work, future options, and completed work.
* Manage major technical projects, including:
   The design and implementation of our internal S3-like infrastructure leveraging Ceph. 
   Development of a fault-tolerant Django application that managed, provisioned, and ordered all of our physical and virtual infrastructure. 
   Implementation of MySQL database pools within the Mailchimp monolith application for more efficient scale and fault tolerance.
* Select many different project management tools and techniques depending on the project type, including kanban-inspired work visualization, WIP limiting, pair programming, gantt-like visualizations of work sequencing and timelines, and scrumlike ceremonies and sprint planning.
* Create a lightweight project management processes to handle work ideation, ingress, visualization, project prioritization and sequencing, availability planning, execution, and retrospection.
* Foster a community of practice centered around agile and lean concepts and activities, continuous process improvement, team facilitation, and workshopping.
* Incorporate workshops to help teams experiment with their workflows and improve their processes. Topics included work visualization, productivity tools, just-in-time flow, getting from obstacles to outcomes, and prioritization techniques.
* Embed in and coach multiple technical teams through continual agile improvements depending on their needs and desires. Teams include our Site Reliability team, our Systems Services team, and our Networking team.

**Manager, Systems Engineering**<br>
**February 2015 - February 2016**
* Grew the Systems Engineering team from two to 10 engineers through heavy recruitment, interviews, onboarding programs, and continuous training.
* Created an internal support and project pipeline which managed internal customer requests for work, lowered response times, and visualized team capacity. The team still has a similar process in place to this day, which allows them to take on and complete more requests per week, have stronger feedback loops with internal customers, and reduce cycle times and work blockages.
* Worked with the team to build an emergency response framework which handled alerting, incident response and command, and post-mortems. Lessons from this are helping us to respond more efficiently and effectively to outages that affect our users, and we still have this process in place today.
* Designed a simple on-call system that staffed team members to specific functions based on work types that came to the team and helped manage our capacity to take on that work.
* Managed a project to build out our Seattle datacenter which houses our disaster recovery databases. This project was the first officially managed project at Mailchimp, and it showed the value add that an explicit project management job function provides. This project was a catalyst for the creation of a project manager role in Engineering.

**Systems Engineer**<br>
**May 2013 - February 2015**
* Worked in a small team to directly build out and scale two colocated data centers in Atlanta and Suwanee, GA to handle Mailchimp’s rapidly growing user base.
* Designed baked-in redundancy across each layer of our infrastructure: firewalls, routers, switches, ethernet ports, load balancers, web servers, databases, power supplies, and power circuits were all redundant in some way.
* Led the effort to transfer all of our infrastructure from SoftLayer to our colocated facilities, which led to reduced mean time to failure for our systems, increased uptime for our users, and gave usan easier and robust way to scale.
* Built and configured software and network infrastructure to scale our hardware infrastructure, which handled growth from around two to 9 million users during my time in this role.
* Provisioned infrastructure for Mailchimp’s developers and worked on onboarding materials to instill a self-service approach to getting an application from ideation to production.
* Part of the team that built the Mailchimp Pro product offering, which formed the foundation that became our “data pipeline” feeding all internal Mailchimp applications.
* Piloted Jira and Confluence to keep track of all of our work on the team, which was adopted by the whole department and eventually the entire company.

### [Akamai Technologies](https://akamai.com/), Atlanta
**Network Infrastructure Technician**<br>
**August 2011 - May 2013**
* Coordinated with a team of Network Infrastructure Technicians and Engineers to deploy and maintain thousands of servers that power Akamai’s content delivery and storage networks.
* Traveled around to and worked in 5 different colocated datacenters scattered across metropolitan Atlanta.
