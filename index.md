# Here's a bunch of stuff that I've done.
## My Professional Intent
After working for 5 years in management roles, I'm seeking a change in my career. I'm joining the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com) and taking their [Software Engineering course](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp/atlanta#curriculum) in the summer/fall of 2020.

There are some things you can do here.
## Take a gander at my [resume](./files/resume.html).
