## Who I am
Recent coding bootcamp graduate with over a decade of technical experience. I [blog](./blog/blog-flatiron.html) about code, keep my [resume](./resume.html) up to date, and showcase some of my [projects](https://github.com/mkopsho).

I'm currently looking for work. Please hit me up anywhere in the side bar if you think I'd be a good fit for you, or just to chat!

While not at work, you'll probably find me brewing beer, playing analog/digital games, or fishing! Would also love to chat about any of these, as well.
