### My professional intent
After working for 5 years in management roles, I'm seeking a change in my career. I've joined the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com) and am currently taking their [Software Engineering course](https://flatironschool.com/career-courses/coding-bootcamp/atlanta#curriculum). I should graduate in late September if all goes well!

If you'd like to talk, feel free to hit me up at any of the places listed in the sidebar.

## There are some things you can do here:
* Take a gander at my [resume](./resume.html).
* Read my [blog](./blog/flatiron-blog.html) documenting my experience at Flatiron School.
* Scrutinize my [projects](./projects.html) (TBD).
