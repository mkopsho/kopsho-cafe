## Who I am
Recent coding bootcamp graduate with over a decade of technical experience. I [blog](./blog/blog-flatiron.html) about code, keep my [resume](./resume.html) up to date, and showcase some of my [projects](https://github.com/mkopsho).

## What I do
While not working on code, you'll probably find me brewing [simple beers](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/keeping-it-simple-with-smash-brewing/), playing [board](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars)/[card](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/92415/skull)/[tabletop](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/55690/kingdom-death-monster)/[RP](https://www.mothershiprpg.com/)/video games, or fishing! Would also love to chat about any of these, as well.

## Where I'm going
I'm currently looking for work. Please hit me up anywhere in the sidebar if you think I'd be a good fit for you, or just to chat!
