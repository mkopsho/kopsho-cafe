**DnD Companion** - Ruby | [Github](https://github.com/mkopsho/dnd-companion) | [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdRx_dLqikA)  
*A helper app for fledgling Dungeon Masters that displays spells, conditions, and monsters in Dungeons and Dragons.*  
* Crawled the [DnD 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) to pull and parse data, which was then used to build objects that users could interact with.
* Built a command line interface that handles menu options, errors, and displays formatted data on screen to help dungeon masters reference data in seconds rather than having to spend minutes paging through a rulebook.  

**Homebrew Ledger** - Ruby/Sinatra | [Github](https://github.com/mkopsho/homebrew-ledger) | [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2BMZ_qS2Nc)  
*A storage and sharing app for homebrewing recipes as well as a beer ingredients database.*  
* Used [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) to build a web application following RESTful conventions and allowing users to create, read, update, and delete homebrewing recipes.
* Created an ingredients spreadsheet and a [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/) task to load it into the database for users to use in their recipes.
* Handled user creation and authentication with [bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js#readme), securing user-provided password data.

*Geolocation app for fishers to pin and share their catches, as well as add conditional information about those catches.*
* Used the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation) to embed an interactive map and to allow users to mark and describe their catches.
* Leveraged a [Rails backend API](https://api.rubyonrails.org/) to store, retrieve, and modify data (as JSON) from the JavaScript frontend.
* Created and leveraged ES6-style class declarations to make this JavaScript project more object-oriented.

**STWRDSHP** - React | [Github](https://github.com/mkopsho/stwrdshp) | [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM5QxQKRFQ4)

## Experience
### [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), Atlanta | *May 2013 - April 2020*
**Project Manager, Engineering**  
*March 2016 - April 2020*
* Managed major technical projects including: in-house object storage design and implementation leveraging Ceph; the development of a large scale Django application managed all of our infrastructure; design and implementation of MySQL database “pools” within the Mailchimp monolith application for more efficient scale and fault tolerance.
* Used a versatile approach to project management that was dependent on the work type and context, which built expertise in agile, lean, and waterfall ways of working.
* Tracked all projects across the Engineering department including work in process, future options, and completed work; this helped the department’s leadership make decisions about scheduling, hiring, and staffing.
* Created a lightweight project process to handle ideation, ingress, visualization, and prioritization; this helped the department’s leadership make decisions about technology choice, risks, cost/benefit analyses, and budgets.
* Fostered a company-wide community of practice centered around agile/lean concepts and activities, continuous process improvement, and good practices around group facilitation.
* Acted as an agile coach embedded on multiple technical teams and used several agile techniques to encourage continuous improvements, depending on their needs and desires.

**Manager, Systems Engineering**  
*February 2015 - February 2016*
* Grew the Systems Engineering team from four to 10 engineers via recruitment, onboarding, and training.
* Created an internal support pipeline which managed internal customer requests for work, causing lower response times, lower resolution times, more coverage, and allowed us to take on more requests per week.
* Worked with multiple technical teams to build an emergency response framework which handled alerting, incident response, and post-mortems; allowing us to respond to customer-facing outages with more speed and precision.
* Managed a project to build out our Seattle data center, which houses our disaster recovery databases. This project was the first officially managed project at Mailchimp, and it showed the value add of project management.

**Systems Engineer**  
*May 2013 - February 2015*
* Worked on a small team to directly build out and grow two collocated data centers in Atlanta and Suwanee, GA to handle Mailchimp’s rapidly growing user base.
* Built and configured software and network infrastructure to scale our physical infrastructure, which withstood growth from about two to nine million users in this timeframe.
* Designed and implemented redundancy across each layer of our infrastructure: firewalls, routers, switches, ethernet ports, load balancers, web servers, databases, power supplies, and power circuits were all redundant in some way.
* Led the effort to transfer all of our infrastructure from SoftLayer to our collocated facilities, which led to reduced mean time to failure for our systems and increased uptime for our users.
* Provisioned infrastructure for Mailchimp’s developers and worked on onboarding materials to enable a self-service approach to getting a web application from local developer environments to production.
